### JS Debugging

- When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it, but *you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it, too.*

- When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. Here, we will discuss about:

    - __COMMON PROBLEMS:__ Common sources of errors, and how to solve them.

    - __HANDLING ERRORS:__ How code can deal with potential errors gra cefully.
