### Intoductory HTML and and JavaScript

### HTML

- Understanding HTML and CSS can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate with their audience more effectively, and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams.

- All websites ude HTML and CSS

- When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

#### HTML structure

- In order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents.

- HTML uses __elements__ to describes the structure of web pages

- HTML elements are usually made up of two tags: an *_opening tag _* and a *_closing tag._* (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

    - The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
    - The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
    - The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow youto view multiple pages at the same time).
    - Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
    - A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.

- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a __name__ and a __value__, separated by an equals sign.

- In the example below, an attribute called *lang* is used to indicate the language used in this element. The value of this attribute on this page specifies it is in "US English".

    - <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>
