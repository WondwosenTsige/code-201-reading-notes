### Understanding the problem domain

- Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming.

- Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

- As developers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.

- It is very difficult to solve a problem before you know the question.  *It’s like buzzing in on Jeopardy before you hear the clue and shouting out random questions.*

#### What can you do about it?

- If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

    1. __Make the problem domain easier__
    2. __Get better at understanding the problem domain__

- __You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.__ i.e *that it is often beneficial to take a part of the problem and fully understand that part before expanding the problem domain.*

- Games are really good at this.  Look at most games today and you’ll find that you start with a very small problem domain.  The first level is usually a tutorial that has a basic set of things you can do so that you don’t get overwhelmed.  But, as you advance through the levels, you usually find they get harder and introduce new concepts that build gradually on what you know, until you understand a pretty large problem domain.

- The other choice is to become better at understanding problem domains.  As developers, we tend to think that sitting down and talking to customers or business people who know about the problem domain is a waste of time. *It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.*  Best to resist the temptation to “not waste anymore time talking” and make sure you understand a problem inside and out before you try and solve it with code.  *It is much more expensive and time consuming to do things over than it is to do them right the first time.*
